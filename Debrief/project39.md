# Project 39

In general, both platforms perform their main function (to build a website) well. We didn't find any significant differences regarding the features or components needed for building a website. 

What we really see as a difference is the users' approaches. While the target audience of Webflow should be less experienced users, perhaps with the need to configure simpler websites, Redocly users have some technical background and probably desire to have more customization options.

In addition, an important thing is the way of the user. As for the first step contacting with a marketing website, user would look for some guidence. We tried to simulate this way and looked for documents. While Docs of Redocly are placed in navbar, it took us a while to find the documents of Webflow. 

On the other hand, digging deeper to Webflow infrustructure we found Webflow university with video tutorials which introduce the user to the platform. We believe having interactive components to introduce the product to the user is pretty useful and expected in the modern world. So, this is the area where Redocly could improve the user experience.

**Some comparison of the random subset of features:**
| Feature | Redocly | Webflow |
|--------|---------|----------|
|Protect pages behind login|yes|no|
|Payments|Not out of the box| Yes, using apps and plugins|
| Templates | Yes, but small amount and hard to start with | Yes |
| Tutorials | Mostly docs | Webflow University |
| User technical level | Experienced | Beginner |

## What made you smile?

* We couln't find an option to protect website behind login in Webflow
* Easier to find necessary docs in Redocly (especially using AI)
* Some components are easier to add in Redocly by writing few lines of code than looking for suitable component in Webflow.
* Webflow builder is too complicated
* Adding pages to Redocly seems easier than Webflow (we spent more time finding how to add pages in Webflow builder; adding files by drag-n-drops seems to be super easy instead)

## What did you find confusing?

* Webflow has attractive list of templates to choose
* Users without technical background will be able to create minimal website using Webflow builder
* Redocly has higher entry threshold 
* Its hard to find organization level settings in Redocly
* Will be good to have onboarding navigation for newly registered users (I think we have it already)
* The cool feature of Webflow is their "Webflow University" with list of interactive learning examples, easy to follow videos, forum, etc.
* Its impossible to provide accurate comparison between Webflow and Redocly due to lack of experience with Webflow just in 2 hours
