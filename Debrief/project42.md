- What are the main things each platform does?
- Developer portals software catalogs
- Any type of entity catalogs (software, apis, other components) with possibility to integrate other systems, monitoring, etc
- No code developer portals 
- Developer portals based on API definitions

--- 

- What features look particularly useful or slick?
- -

- The feature we found particularly useful is Monitoring or API status page where developer will be able to see API uptime or API status

- Are there any cool ideas or unique takes on features in either platform?

## What did you find confusing?
- While having the editor opened, but with no file chosen it's pretty confusing to understand what's going on, as a user doesn't have any hints making them open a file.

- All the platforms provide overhelming UX. It's pretty confusing to find core features and their examples.
- Dependence between creating a new file with an open folder and closed one. With the open folder some action (blink) is visible, but any file is created. But once a user close the folder the file is created. Expected behavior is to create a new file independent of whether the folder is open or closed.

### Ideas

- Provide embedding widget for API Monitoring chart to be able to easily embed it on developer portal page
- Display API catalog results in table view
- Software relations chart (makes sense only in scope of software rather than API definitions)
