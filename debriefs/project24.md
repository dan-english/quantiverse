# Project Twenty Four: SSO with Okta

Missed the big button in Okta that says "ADMIN"
- which made me lose time trying to find the "Applications" section to create the integration.
  


4:16 in recording - I don't see the extra treams like Adam does in the reacording.
User is in all groups within Okta.
