# Project Twenty Nine: Make Widget Work Again


Went down another rabbit hole today regardoing page layout. (hence the pinks & grays) sort of acheived what I wanted, page height is still a bit buggy 

Code highlighting with HTML was a bit buggy, I couldn't get it to highlight add/remove lines using code-,code+ ended up saying the file was `PHP`

Couldn't determine how to render this with a 'code block' /string instead of a file.
