# Project 48: Respect x-security extension 

## What made you smile?
* It was feeling like "Cicada 3301" quest

## What did you find confusing?
* It was hard to find a Respect Monitoring config documentation (it took ~5min)
* When you need to make an indentation in the Editor, it always suggests autocompletion and fill when you hit enter again
* When you are trying to insert a not allowed symbol in some inputs(e.g. new env variables, new branch), the cursor is put at the end
* Sometimes a "Word wrap" button is missing
