## What made you smile?

* Using "next" for updating package json works well. It's great surprising idea! But this doesn't work in local environment.
* It was interesting to observe how Copilot transform step-by-step guide into code walkthrough. It was helpful to see that AI can create files.
* At the end, after facing all the issues the task was successfully done. Although the code highlighting within code walkthroug doesn't wrok well. We'd expect to see every step corresponding to the highlighted code sample.

## What did you find confusing?
* Subtle mistake (comma between filesets and filters) completele brakes the generated walkthrough. It took us a long time to fing the reason as presented errors were not relevant and didn't provide us to the real issue.
* We cannot call working with AI a successful experience, as if the user is not a tecnical person, it's almost imposible for them to find the correct reason for the issue.
