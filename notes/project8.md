# Project Eight: Versioned Content


Frustrations:
- platform was slow today
- had a hard link in the nav to version @1.0 which had me going around in circles for awhile.


-- any reason why we dont pull a version from the open-api spec?
-- why do i have an instance each time in the catalog view and no way to determine how they differ
-- no version option at catalog level?

when using a sidebars.yaml in the museum directory 



Configuring the directories in the sidebars (root) works as desired.
Adding a version.yaml file to this setup causes each version of the API to explode in that grouping (not desired)

Adding the directory to the nav config got a link in the header for the latest version of the Museum API
- didnt work out how to add a label to that


Catalog view now only shows one instance of the Museum API with clicking through to get the version selector
