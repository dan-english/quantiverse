# Project Twenty Five: Chefs Hats


Went down a rabbit hole with this Project
- looked into custom markdoc tags and completed the example using the quiz. Suggested some changes to that page and the tree view as it didn't match the description
  
After completing that I then came back to this project and started fresh.
Imported the feedback component and added the config into the redocly yaml.
then imported the stars icon and hacked away converting those to Hats
then updated the styles to use a different colour 


Could be nice to see a preview of the icons in the Theme Components view and maybe even view the code to save exporting?
