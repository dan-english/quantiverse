# Project Six: Kitchen API
Asked chat GPT to generate the API spec but also generated some duplicated content (ingredient GET|POST)
Play with the try it functionality / replay functionality?
- couldn't determine if apath parameter could/should be set as part of the example? Train-booking generated the same issue.



When generating an error the message could be displayed longer or ask the user to clear the message/auto clear when resending.
