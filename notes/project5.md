# Project Five: Partial Danger

Basic partial with admonition was clear and easy to get up and running.
Added some custom styling around the danger partial.

It was unclear if it was possible to use a custom directory to store partials in. The docs explicitly said *_partials* directory but the 'hints' on the project
page implied that maybe it was possible to use an alternative directory.
